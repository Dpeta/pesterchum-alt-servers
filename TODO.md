# TODO LIST : )

## ADD
 - Memoserv support.
 - Use memopermabanmsg function?

## FIX
 - Mask & target not being passed to ``_max_msg_len``.
    - Look into using a different IRC library?
 - No error message when Pesterchum fails to join a channel. (For example, when the channel name length is over CHANNELLEN)
 - Choose memo window doesn't get updated on theme change.
 - Right click menu's color doesn't get updated on theme change in memos.
 - Closed windows sometimes stay open.
    - Should confirm if this is still an issue.
 - help() causes console to crash...? 
    - Console is hopelessly broken, it'd be easier to make a list of what commands *don't* cause it to crash. Does anyone use this?
