# TODO LIST : )

## FIX
 - Choose memo window doesn't get updated on theme change.
 - Right click menu's color doesn't get updated on theme change in memos.

## CHANGE
 - When everything has been tested and more people have compatible versions, switch Pesterchum over to using metadata and message tags by default instead of wrapping its protocol in PRIVMSG. The current method should stay available for compatibility.
